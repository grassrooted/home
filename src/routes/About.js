                    Why Campaign Finance Transparency Matters
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Campaign finance transparency is the cornerstone of a healthy democracy. It ensures voters know who is funding the campaigns that influence local policies, from city council decisions to school board budgets. By shedding light on the sources of financial support, we empower citizens to make informed decisions and hold candidates accountable. Local elections often have an outsized impact on everyday life, and understanding the money behind them is essential for fostering trust and integrity in the electoral process.
